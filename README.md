# Eye movement classification in aid of the cVEP Speller

This is the repository holding all MATLAB procedures used to complete my thesis. The aim of the thesis was to analyze ocular artefacts present in EEG recordings and to use them to predict the gaze position of the user for faster classification of input from the cVEP Visual Speller BCI.
